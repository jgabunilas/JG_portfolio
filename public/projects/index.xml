      <description>View this project on GitHub&#xD;Project Summary Look up at a clear night sky, and one can see that there are countless celestial bodies beyond our humble solar system. Have you ever wondered how many of those bodies are actual planets? Astronomers certainly have. The NASA Exoplanet Archive&#xD;hosts a repository of exoplanet&#xD;data collected by the Keplar Space Telescope&#xD;. The telescope was in use for over nine years from March 7, 2009 through its retirement on October 30, 2018.</description>

      <description>View this project on GitHub&#xD;Project Summary This exercise analyzes various properties of local weather as a function of location, seeking to understand whether temperature, cloudiness, windiness, or humidity for a given city is correlated with its latitudinal positioning. It makes extensive use of the following tools:&#xA;Pandas - data cleanup and organization Matplotlib - data visualization Scipy - regression analysis Requests - API requests Part I: WeatherPy In the first part of this analysis, weather data retrieved from the OpenWeather API is organized to determine whether a city&amp;rsquo;s latitudinal position may be related to various properties of the weather.</description>
